                The Street Style sells a curation of different designers and shops ranging widely from items purchased on the streets of Rio to the most exclusive high-end and upmarket Boutiques of Buenos Aires.

                In times of fast fashion and mass production, purchasing a piece that only you can wear is definitely a privilege. 
                
                At The Street Style, you can afford to be distinctively yourself. 
                
                Often, we only bring one or two of our designs over to Australia, hand-picked from the most exciting South American designers.
                
                "You don't need to be a celebrity to have a dress uniquely yours," Melo says.
                
                We personally know every single creator we work with. We strive for strong personal connections and professional partnerships with those artists and artisans.
                
                Some of our designers have won awards like the "Most Sustainable Label in Brazil". Others have been featured in museums such as MoMa in New York, 
                
                Centre Pompidou in Paris and more locally,at Tasmania's MONA. </pre>
